## Rearrange views in layout

ParaView now provides the ability to evenly rearrange the views size inside a layout.

When using multiples views in the same layout, you can create and manually resize views,
while keeping on overall rectangle global shape.
However, it may get frustrating to create an evenly spaced layout manually.

Now you can use the "Rearrange Views" action from the "Views" menu to independently resize
width, height or both (horizontal, vertical or grid mode).
This is also available in context menu from Layout tab.
