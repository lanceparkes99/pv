## Preference to limit the available reader list

In the Settings dialog under the Miscellaneous tab, there is a new "Reader Selection" list.
The user can uncheck the box next to any reader they don't want to see listed in the
"File .. Open" dialog. The titlebar checkbox will turn the entire list on or off. Any
new readers are enabled by default.
